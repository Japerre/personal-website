After the news broke that [Duvel]({{<ref "Duvel-brewery-hacked.md">}}) was hacked on Wednesday, 2 other Belgian companies also came forward. [Primoglass](https://www.hln.be/binnenland/na-cyberaanval-duvel-moortgat-ook-bij-tweede-grote-belgische-bedrijf-sprimoglass-ligt-productie-grotendeels-stil-om-zelfde-reden~a185872d/) on Thursday and [Koffie Beyers](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2024/03/08/koffie-beyers-in-puurs-slachtoffer-van-cyberaanval/) today (Friday). Primoglass will probably not pay the ransom and is getting its production line back online. Koffie Beyers is located only 3 km away from Duvel. The Antwerp police is looking if there is a connection between the two cases. It's not yet clear which hacker group is responsible for the attack.

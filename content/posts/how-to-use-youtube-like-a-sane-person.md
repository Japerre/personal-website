Transitioning to [FreeTube](https://freetubeapp.io/), an open-source desktop client for YouTube, has significantly transformed my approach to content consumption on the platform. Available on GitHub, FreeTube offers a comprehensive YouTube browsing experience, mirroring almost all functionalities except for the ability to post comments â€” though reading them is still an option. Switching to FreeTube has fostered a more intentional and mindful engagement with content. The absence of algorithm-driven recommendations means I'm no longer passively consuming whatever is served up by YouTube's algorithms. Instead, I actively choose what to watch by keeping up with channels I've consciously decided to follow. 

Reflecting on my early YouTube days around the age of 12, my enthusiasm was tied to gaming channels like Pewdiepie, VanossGaming, Smosh, and SkyDoesMinecraft. Back then, my excitement was purely for new uploads in my subscription box, barely glancing at the homepage. However, as YouTube's recommendation algorithms improved, my habits shifted towards the recommended videos, sidelining my subscription box and leading me down a path of content dictated by the platform, resulting in me watching BS video's I don't even like or want to be watching. FreeTube's elimination of the recommended page has been liberating. The clutter of irrelevant or manipulative content is gone, replaced by a focused stream from channels I genuinely enjoy. 

Privacy is another cornerstone of FreeTube's appeal. The absence of a mandatory Google account sidesteps Google's pervasive surveillance. FreeTube employs web scraping to gather content, a method where the software programmatically downloads and parses YouTube web pages to extract video information without directly interacting with YouTube's APIs. From the [Freetube Github](https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube):

>"FreeTube does not use any official APIs to obtain data. While YouTube can still see your video requests, it can no longer track you using cookies or JavaScript. Your subscriptions and history are stored locally on your computer and never sent out. Using a VPN or Tor is highly recommended to hide your IP while using FreeTube."

In essence, adopting FreeTube has been a game-changer, shifting control back to me and away from algorithmic determinations, while significantly enhancing my online privacy.

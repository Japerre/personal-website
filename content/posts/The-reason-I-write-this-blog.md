I just came across a [blog post](https://fs.blog/writing-to-think/) that is just so well written. It puts into words exactly how I think about writing! I aspire to one day be able to write like that. It puts into words why I wan't to have a blog. I don't write for the reader... I write for myself. So I can put my thoughts on paper. So I can delve deeper into the subjects that I'm really interested in. While writing [my previous blog]({{<ref "encodings-confuse-me.md">}}) post, I really feel like I learned something that I will never forgot, just because I wrote it down and tried to make it easy to understand for the reader. I had to really think about how to structure it, and it stuck with me. It may have been a small article, but I am proud of it.

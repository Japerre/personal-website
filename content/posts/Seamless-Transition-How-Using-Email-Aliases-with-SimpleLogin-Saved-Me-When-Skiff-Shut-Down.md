The news recently broke that Skiff is joining Notion and that their email services will come to a halt in 6 months. This practically means that every online account using skiff has to have its email updated in 6 months time. This is mildly annoying to do for one or two websites, but people usually have hundreds of accounts and changing email for every one of them is a very time consuming task. What's worse, is that people often don't know exactly to which sites they're signed up with their email account. They will surely think about their Facebook, Twitter and Youtube account, but what about that obscure crypto exchange you forgot you had an account for? This leaves a big doubt in the back of people's heads: "Did I update all of my accounts?"

I am one of the lucky ones that used Skiff as my main email provider because it provided a very generous free tier. However for me the task won't be laborious at all! And when I am done, I'll know for a fact that all my accounts have been updated... 

I can say this with certainty because I employ 2 good practises

### I use email aliases with [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io/)

I use a seperate email alias for all of my accounts. That means that I only need to go to the SimpleLogin website and make all my aliases point to a new email address (Back to Proton we all go). That is still a little annoying, but way less annoying than loging into every website, requesting an email change and then confirming that it was indeed you that requested the email change. Furthermore I am in no rush to do this. My email aliases aren't going anywhere ðŸ˜Ž. 

I wholeheartedly recommend SimpleLogin! Especially for students (such as myself at the time of writing) it is 50% off. Even better, it's 50% off for life! With the discount it costs $15 per year for unlimited aliases. 
From the [SimpleLogin website](https://simplelogin.io/docs/subscription/student-discount/): 
> "Currently we offer 50% reduction over the yearly plan for anyone working/studying in an educational institution. This reduction doesnâ€™t have an expiration date, meaning you can benefit from it even after leaving the institution."

### I use a password manager

For some websites that don't allow signing up with aliases ðŸ˜” or for sites where you don't want to use an alias, I am still signed up with my Skiff address. Finding out which sites those are is a piece of cake for me ðŸŽ‚. Just typing my full Skiff email address in the search bar in my Bitwarden Vault yields me all the accounts for which I am signed up with that email. Than I just had to manually change those, et voilÃ . 

### Conclusion

In conclusion: If there are still accounts out their using my Skiff email address, than that is on me for not putting it in my PW manager. I can rest assured that the migration was successful and more importantly complete!

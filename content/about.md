Hi I am Tibo, a ... uuhh a techn.. NO, NO, that's not it. Writing an about page is actually more difficult than I would've thought. Well let's just say you will get to know me if you read my blog. I am by no means an expert in anything. But I would like to share with the world the things I think about. I am interested in the following (non exhaustive list of things).

- Privacy (in all its forms)
- Cybersecurity
- Computer Science


I could tell you the things that I'm good at, but that wouldn't be so humble of me, that's why I'll give you a list of things I'm not good at, but will be good at in the future.

- writing websites using static site generator [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/)
- markdown
- git
- Linux
- VIM
